# RDK4 CAPSENSE™ Buttons

Rutronik Development Kit 3 Programmable System-on-Chip CY8C4149AZE-S598 "CAPSENSE Buttons" Code Example. 

This code example demonstrates the CAPSENSE™ buttons that are working in CSX mode.

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox™ software](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2025.4.0
- The latest hardware release [RDK4 Rev2](https://github.com/RutronikSystemSolutions/RDK4_Hardware_Files).

## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v11.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>




1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialogue.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialogue, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

### Operation

The firmware example uses a KitProg3 UART for debugging output and KitProg3 I2C for communication with a "CapSense Tuner" software. Only one peripheral may be used at a time. Use your preferred terminal software to track the debug output or simply load a ModusToolbox™ native "Terminal" tool.

The code example initializes the CAPSENSE™ peripheral and also the library that enables communication with a "CapSense Tuner" software via I2C. 

There are 3 CAPSENSE™ buttons CSB1, CSB2, and CSB3 onboard. After the firmware has started successfully the touch on any of the buttons should turn on and off the corresponding Red, Green or Blue LEDs in a D10 RGB LED package.

Launch the "CapSense Tuner" from the **Quick Panel** Tools section and select the I2C interface in the KitProg3 UART menu as it is shown:

Click on **Connect** and **Start** to establish the connection via I2C. Select all the slider sensors to be monitored in **Widget Explorer**.

### Debugging

If you successfully have imported the example, the debug configurations are already prepared to use with the KitProg3 or MiniProg4. Open the ModusToolbox™ perspective and find the Quick Panel. Click on the desired debug launch configuration and wait for the programming to complete and the debugging process to start.

#### SBC Development Mode

A special mode, called SBC Development Mode, is available during software development or debugging of the system. The watchdog counter is stopped and does not need to be triggered. This mode can be accessed by setting the TEST [**FO3**] pin to GND during SBC Init Mode.

## Legal Disclaimer

The evaluation board including the software is for testing purposes only and, because it has limited functions and limited resilience, is not suitable for permanent use under real conditions. If the evaluation board is nevertheless used under real conditions, this is done at one’s responsibility; any liability of Rutronik is insofar excluded.
